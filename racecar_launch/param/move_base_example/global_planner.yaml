GlobalPlanner:
    allow_unknown: true
    #Specifies whether or not to allow the planner to create plans that traverse unknown space.

    default_tolerance: 0.0
    #A tolerance on the goal point for the planner. The planner will attempt to create a plan that is as close to the specified goal as possible but no further than default_tolerance away.

    visualize_potential: false
    #Specifies whether or not to visualize the potential area computed via a PointCloud2.

    use_dijkstra: true
    #If true, use dijkstra's algorithm. Otherwise, A*.

    use_quadratic: true
    #If true, use the quadratic approximation of the potential. Otherwise, use a simpler calculation.

    use_grid_path: false
    #If true, create a path that follows the grid boundaries. Otherwise, use a gradient descent method.

    old_navfn_behavior: false
    #If for some reason, you want global_planner to exactly mirror the behavior of navfn, set this to true (and use the defaults for the other boolean parameters)

    lethal_cost: 253 #Lethal Cost (dynamic reconfigure)
    neutral_cost: 50 #Neutral Cost (dynamic reconfigure)
    cost_factor: 3.0 #Factor to multiply each cost from costmap by (dynamic reconfigure)
    publish_potential: true #Publish Potential Costmap (dynamic reconfigure)

    orientation_mode: 0
    #How to set the orientation of each point(None=0, Forward=1, Interpolate=2, ForwardThenInterpolate=3, Backward=4, Leftward=5, Rightward=6) (dynamic reconfigure)
    orientation_window_size: 1
    #What window to use to determine the orientation based on the position derivative specified by the orientation mode (dynamic reconfigure)
