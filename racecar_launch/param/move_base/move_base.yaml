planner_frequency: 10.0   #The rate in Hz at which to run the global planning loop. If the frequency is set to 0.0, the global planner will only run when a new goal is received or the local planner reports that its path is blocked.
planner_patience: 5.0     #How long the planner will wait in seconds in an attempt to find a valid plan before space-clearing operations are performed.

controller_frequency: 10  #The rate in Hz at which to run the control loop and send velocity commands to the base.
controller_patience: 3.0  #How long the controller will wait in seconds without receiving a valid control before space-clearing operations are performed.

conservative_reset_dist: 3.0    #The distance away from the robot in meters beyond which obstacles will be cleared from the costmap when attempting to clear space in the map.

recovery_behavior_enabled: true #Whether or not to enable the move_base recovery behaviors to attempt to clear out space.
clearing_rotation_allowed: false #Determines whether or not the robot will attempt an in-place rotation when attempting to clear out space.

shutdown_costmaps: false  #Determines whether or not to shutdown the costmaps of the node when move_base is in an inactive state

oscillation_timeout: 10.0 #How long in seconds to allow for oscillation before executing recovery behaviors. A value of 0.0 corresponds to an infinite timeout.
oscillation_distance: 0.2 #How far in meters the robot must move to be considered not to be oscillating. Moving this far resets the timer counting up to the ~oscillation_timeout
